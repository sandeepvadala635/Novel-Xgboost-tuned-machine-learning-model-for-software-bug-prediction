# Novel-Xgboost-tuned-machine-learning-model-for-software-bug-prediction

Software bug prediction is important during software development and maintenance. The early prediction of defective modules in developing software can help the development team to utilize the available resources efficiently and effectively to deliver high quality software product in limited time. 
Machine learning approach works by extracting the hidden patterns among software attributes. In this study, several machine learning classification techniques are used to predict the software defects in NASA datasets JM1, CM1, KC2 and PC3.
New model was proposed based on tuning the existing XGBoost model. The results achieved were compared  model outperformed them for all datasets.

Now a days Software project success is a major challenge. A project manager biggest headache is defects or bugs.
These Bugs occurs due to poor design and implementation of code.
The biggest challenge in software industry is to develop a 100% bug free application. 
This issue is difficult to achieve by the software development companies even if they are kept on testing.
